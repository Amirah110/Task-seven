 creating a web user interface (UI) using an HTML slider to control the angle of the servo motor.

The slider value is sent directly to the ESP32 controller via a web server hosted on the ESP32, which then adjusts the angle of the servo motor according to the written command. 

Then HTML code is included in the ESP32's firmware, allowing the ESP32 to serve the web page and handle real-time modifications to the auxiliary engine without having to store the data in a database.

Run the servo motor.
